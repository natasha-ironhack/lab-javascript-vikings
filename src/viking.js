should receive 1 argument (the damage)
should remove the received damage from the health property

// Viking

/*
A Viking is a Soldier with an additional property, their name. They also have 
a different receiveDamage() method and new method, battleCry().

Modify the Viking class, have it inherit from Soldier, re-implement the 
receiveDamage() method for Viking, and add a new battleCry() method.

inheritance
Viking should extend Soldier

class
should receive 3 arguments (name, health & strength)
should receive the name property as its 1st argument
should receive the health property as its 2nd argument
should receive the strength property as its 3rd argument

attack() method
(This method should be inherited from Soldier, no need to re-implement it.)

should be a function
should receive 0 arguments
should return the strength property of the Viking

receiveDamage() method
(This method needs to be re-implemented for Viking because the Viking version 
  needs to have different return values.)

should be a function
should receive 1 argument (the damage)
should remove the received damage from the health property
if the Viking is still alive, it should return "NAME has received DAMAGE points 
of damage"
if the Viking dies, it should return "NAME has died in act of combat"

battleCry() method
(Learn more about battle cries.) (link)

should be a function
should receive 0 arguments
should return "Odin Owns You All!"

// Saxon

/*
A Saxon is a weaker kind of Soldier. Unlike a Viking, a Saxon has no name. 
Their receiveDamage() method will also be different than the original Soldier 
version.

Modify the Saxon, constructor function, have it inherit from Soldier and 
re-implement the receiveDamage() method for Saxon.

inheritance
Saxon should extend Soldier

class
You don't have to include constructor method since this class will inherit 
perfectly from the parents class, both, the health and the strength 
(it extends Soldier class ðŸ˜‰ )

attack() method
(This method should be inherited from Soldier, no need to re-implement it.)

should be a function
should receive 0 arguments
should return the strength property of the Saxon

receiveDamage() method
(This method needs to be re-implemented for Saxon because the Saxon version 
  needs to have different return values.)

should be a function
should receive 1 argument (the damage)
should remove the received damage from the health property
if the Saxon is still alive, it should return "A Saxon has received DAMAGE
 points of damage"
if the Saxon dies, it should return "A Saxon has died in combat"
